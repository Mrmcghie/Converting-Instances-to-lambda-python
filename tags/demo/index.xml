By Default Terraform will create a local state file (terraform.tfstate), this does not work when collaborating as each person needs to have the latest version of the state data prior to performing any Terraform actions. In addition you need to ensure that nobody else is running Terraform at the same time. Having a remote state helps mitigate these issues.</description></item><item><title>Terraform: Multi-cloud demo - Part 1 - Foundations</title><link>https://davehart.co.uk/post/terraform-multi-cloud-demo-part-1-foundations/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 15:40:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davehart.co.uk/post/terraform-multi-cloud-demo-part-1-foundations/</guid><description>I have been fortunate enough to be given an opportunity to help colleagues at my workplace on their journey to HashiCorp Terraform Associate Certification.
As part of the training track being put together (Mostly centred around the great Pluralsight training material from Ned Bellavance) it seemed a demonstration of some of the capabilities of Terraform would be beneficial for those on their learning journey. I decided to write this article as it will supplement the live demo I will be performing on one of the training sessions and may be of use to anyone else on their journey.</description></item></channel></rss>
