This article will show you how to encrypt your volumes using python.
Let&amp;rsquo;s set the scene, you have an environment hosting a number of AWS EC2 instances and now security have said, &amp;ldquo;Hey, these EBS volumes should be encrypted!&amp;rdquo; No argument from me. So how do we go about this programmatically.
You can enable default volume encryption in the management console. Check this link out on how to do it.</description></item><item><title>EC2 inventory using AWS Lambda and Python</title><link>https://daveihart.github.io/davehart.co.uk/post/ec2-inventory-using-aws-lambda-and-python/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Oct 2020 07:25:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daveihart.github.io/davehart.co.uk/post/ec2-inventory-using-aws-lambda-and-python/</guid><description>A long while back I wrote a PowerShell script to produce a CSV file of EC2 instances across multiple accounts. The original PowerShell script was running on a Windows server as a scheduled task, oh how we have moved on. About 6 months ago I rewrote the script in Python and then moved it over to AWS Lambda. This was my first really opportunity to use AWS Lambda to execute code in a (Misnomer alert!!) serverless compute service.</description></item><item><title>Terminate EC2 instance by tag using Python</title><link>https://daveihart.github.io/davehart.co.uk/post/terminate-ec2-instance-by-tag-using-python/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Sep 2020 17:35:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daveihart.github.io/davehart.co.uk/post/terminate-ec2-instance-by-tag-using-python/</guid><description>I originally developed this script in bash for a GoCD pipeline. The intention of the script is to decommission instances in batch whilst generating a final snapshot. For those of you that wonder why is Terraform not being used? (You know who you are) Good question. Not everyone is using Terraform yet and refactoring/importing deployment methods will incur costs which some clients are not prepared to pay.
Why change it? The move to Python was a logical one for me, it removes any OS dependency and I also see this as good excuse to practice my Python.</description></item></channel></rss>
