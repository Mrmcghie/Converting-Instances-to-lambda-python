The intention of the script is to decommission instances in batch whilst generating a final snapshot. For those of you that wonder why is Terraform not being used? (You know who you are) Good question. Not everyone is using Terraform yet and refactoring/importing deployment methods will incur costs which some clients are not prepared to pay.
Why change it? The move to Python was a logical one for me, it removes any OS dependency and I also see this as good excuse to practice my Python.</description></item></channel></rss>
