You have written a number of posts, have a few in draft and finally found a theme you liked. What next? Lets discuss backup, swapfile, snapshots, monitoring and certificates.
Backup Last thing you want is to have thrown your heart and sole into a number of posts only for the EC2 instance to crash and you lose all that work.</description></item><item><title>Terminate EC2 instance by tag using Python</title><link>https://daveihart.co.uk/post/terminate-ec2-instance-by-tag-using-python/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Sep 2020 17:35:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daveihart.co.uk/post/terminate-ec2-instance-by-tag-using-python/</guid><description>I originally developed this script in bash for a GoCD pipeline. The intention of the script is to decommission instances in batch whilst generating a final snapshot. For those of you that wonder why is Terraform not being used? (You know who you are) Good question. Not everyone is using Terraform yet and refactoring/importing deployment methods will incur costs which some clients are not prepared to pay.
Why change it? The move to Python was a logical one for me, it removes any OS dependency and I also see this as good excuse to practice my Python.</description></item></channel></rss>
