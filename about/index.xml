I have 25+ years experience working in the IT field. I started off building PC&amp;rsquo;s and developed from there. I have been a Desktop support engineer, SME (Many technologies), performed data centre migrations, infrastructure architect and most recently DevOps engineer and cloud architect. The last 5 years or so I have been working in the cloud space. Here I have performed Active Directory extensions from on-premise into Azure and AWS (design and implementation), design work, security, automation and a lot of coding.</description></item></channel></rss>
